triggerIO-ios-plugins
=====================

* Native sqlite 3 database that supports query CUDing among other things. Uses JSONKit to interact with Trigger.IO. Look at their documentation on: http://docs.trigger.io/en/v1.4/modules/native/index.html

* Kills that nasty form_assist_bar on UIWebViews on devices running any iOS except iOS 6.0. On iOS 6.0 it leaves a thin line. iOS 6.1 works fine though. Updates the webView size on all versions properly. 

* To use merely navigate into /inspector/ios-inspector/ForgeModule/alert/ and grab the .m & .h files of your choice.

* Woot.
